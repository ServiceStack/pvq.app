The new **Blazor Vue** template is ideal for building Fast, SEO-friendly, 100% statically rendered Blazor Web Apps where 
all its dynamic functionally uses Vue.js and the [Vue Components library](https://docs.servicestack.net/vue/) to 
progressively enhance Blazor's statically rendered content - eliminating Blazor's current limitations of being able to 
use Blazor SSR to develop an entire App without any Blazor Interactivity downsides.
