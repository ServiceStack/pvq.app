ServiceStack's new Blazor project template takes advantage of .NET 8 Blazor's new features that redefines modern Web 
Development in C# which we explore in this video overview, covering how the template adopts Blazor's familiar ASP.NET 
Core Identity and Entity Framework for its authentication, utilizes the modern Tailwind CSS framework for beautiful 
responsive design and adopts .NET's best-practice Docker Containerization support for its built-in GitHub Action 
Deployments - enabling a simple ready-made CI solution for deployment to any Linux Host via SSH and Docker compose.
